	<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
	<p>This is the Cookie Policy for Daniel Hospodarsky's website, accessible from danielhospodarsky.com.</p>
	<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></p>
	<p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored, but this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.</p>
	<p>For more general information on cookies, please read <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/how-to-create-a-cookie-policy-for-your-website/">"How to Create a Cookie Policy for Your Website"</a>.</p>

	<h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
	<p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

	<h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>
	<p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser's Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies usually results in also disabling certain functionality and features of the site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.</p>

	<h2>The Cookies We Set</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Google Analytics:</p>
			<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about visitor behavior on our website. Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We, therefore, do not collect or store your personal information (e.g., your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. You can find out more about Google's position on privacy as regards its analytics service <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">here</a>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>More Information</h2>
	<p>Hopefully, that has clarified things for you, and as previously mentioned, if there is something that you are not sure whether you need or not, it is usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
