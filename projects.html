        <h3> Digital Product Management: </h3>
        <p> My Digital Product Management class was an immersive experience that helped me gain practical skills 
            in managing and building digital products. Throughout the course, I learned a wide range of topics such 
            as HTML, Python testing, Scrum project management, Google Analytics, and other relevant technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the key highlights of the course was building websites using HTML. I gained a deep understanding 
            of HTML, and I can now confidently build responsive and visually appealing websites. Additionally, 
            I learned how to run tests using Python and how to implement Scrum project management frameworks to keep 
            my projects organized and efficient.
            <br>
            <br>
            Towards the end of the course, I was tasked with creating my final portfolio website, which was a culmination 
            of all the skills I had learned throughout the semester. I combined my knowledge of HTML, Python, and Scrum 
            frameworks to build an impressive website that showcased my skills and accomplishments.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, my Digital Product Management class was a valuable learning experience that has taught me many 
            different skills. I am excited to apply my newfound knowledge to my new job at Uline post-graduation!

        <h3> Business Analytics Capstone Project: </h3>
        <img src="./images/atlantic_bottling.png" alt="Atlantic Bottling Company" style="width:400px;height:100px;">
        <p> In this class I was given the opportunity to work for the Atlantic Bottling Company, the distributor
            of Coca-Cola products in the midwest. My team was tasked to look into factors including ads, ad types,
            flavors of Coke and different packaging to see how we can maximize trade spend and increase volume.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our first task was to clean the data. We were given spreadsheets of ad data for the past 3 years and
            weekly sales data. We needed to ensure that all of the spreadsheets we were working with were consistent
            with eachother. We reformatted the weekly sales data to create one column for week, a column for sales and
            a column for units. Originally, there were columns for each week of the year.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once all the data was cleaned, we created dummy variables for ad types, different packages, and months. This
            allowed us to run linear regression models to see which variables were most significant. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After interpreting our results, we were able to give Atlantic Bottling some reccommendations on which ads they
            could run more often, cannibalization between packages, how to gain more market share, 
            and what months they should be targeting. I enjoyed working with Atlantic Bottling and have gained many
            useful skills that I can bring to my new job at Uline post-graduation!
