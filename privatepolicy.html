	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Effective date: April 28th, 2023</p>

	<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Daniel Hospodarsky's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, danielhospodarsky.com, and other sites we own and operate.</p>

	<h2>Information we collect</h2>
	<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so-for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
	<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.</p>

	<h2>Analytics</h2>
	<p>We use Google Analytics to measure traffic on our website. Google has their own Privacy Policy which you can review here. If you'd like to opt-out of tracking by Google Analytics, visit the Google Analytics opt-out page.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of our website. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>
	<p>If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.</p>

	<h2>Links to other sites</h2>
	<p>Our website may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
	<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

	<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
	<p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h2>Contact Us</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
